  I've been writing and hosting my own site on the Internet since 2010. The last
  post I've written was <a href="{{ site.posts[0].url }}">{{ site.posts[0].title
    }}</a>. This site is a  <a href="/faq/indieweb">IndieWeb</a>-friendly site.

<p class="measure lh-copy pr3-l tj-s">
  I'd talk more about myself on my <em>home</em> page but that'd detract from
  other parts of my site. I have pages that tell you <a href="/gear/">what I
    use</a>, <a href="/work/">what I tend to do during the day</a>,
  <a href="/subscribe/">how to stay in touch</a> even
  <a href="/now/">what I'm doing now</a>. Lastly, I've created a place for you
  to <a href="/contact/">reach out to me</a>. I want this site to be a decent
  reflection of myself but also provide value to you. Let me know what helps
  you be a better you.
