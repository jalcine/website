I said I was going to [blog more][1]. And to an extent, I did. I wrote a bit
more frequently. But I ended up breaking down and writing out a few 5+ tweet
threads about things I could have expanded on here. Why? Because it's so _easy_
to write a tweet after tweet after tweet. What's going to stop me?

And then the ease of using Twitter to write out a tweet versus my current (but
favored) setup for handling my blog posts:

{% tweet oembed https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/647848957985615872 %}

Of course, there's a difference in perhaps the quality of content provided as
well as the detail that could be provided (unless it's accompanied by video,
which is something I do _rarely_ here). Twitter makes it easy to break up a
thought into a series of thoughts (which is what most of my blog posts have
essentially been, no matter how confusing or jumbled up that might be.

There's always the idea of starting a thread of sorts, but not divulging deeply
into your thoughts on Twitter. The rest of the thread (and perhaps a rehashing
of the thoughts made in the 140 limit) could be done in a blog post. Of course,
there's the angle of visibility[^1]:

There is the notion that with Medium's ability to provide screenshots of
highlighted text and with one's follower base[^2] that classical
blogging[^3] is heading down the river of uselessness. This is something I
wouldn't want Medium to bask in all of the fun for. If anything, we could take
a look at some of their features and see if they can either implemented in a
useful way for each blog. In-line commenting is becoming more of a thing and I,
as a frequent footnoting kind of blogger, love it. I know of Thoughtbot's solution
for inline commenting via its product [Carnival][2]. It looks pretty compelling
of a means to provide inline commenting[^4] (sans the lack of love for Firefox
on Linux :sob:):

One of the values that inline commenting provides is the ability to reply in a
condensed, tweet-sized response. Of course, if it has to be longer, there's the
whole "write a post as an reply" stance, which is something Medium leverages.
Medium obviously has the advantage of this working well since every 'blog' is
contained to its platform; any extra functionality can be added to these blogs
with no real complication. I have _no_ idea (yet) how someone would incorporate
this into something like Wordpress or Tumblr but I am interested in figuring it
out for the latter[^5].

This begs the question of whether or not you'd want to be that social butterfly
with your blog. If so, Medium is your best bet:

{% twitter oembed https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/647865764159078400 %}

My particular use case is different. I write my posts in [Markdown][] and then
generate the static version of this site using [Jekyll][]. So how would I
get something like this for my site? Better question, _why does this even matter_?

## Keeping People Here But Over There As Well

If I had the ability to engage people on my site whilst keeping the conversation
as something that one could interact with on Twitter as well; I wouldn't feel as
guilty for wanting to hash out some tweets and write a post. The guilt lies in
my feeling that the audience loses out from a shortened and jumbled stream of
thoughts. Threads on Twitter have gotten better to view on mobile and desktop
but it doesn't fare too well when you make tangents in conversations. Those
tangents tend to be a means of expanding on that point.

This led to the whole idea of hammering Carnival to allow for comments made as
tweet-able comments as well, provided that they are of an acceptable size.
Again, this is a deviation from the original thought of this post: how can I
feel less guilty of tweeting whilst still writing on my own blog?

### Separation of Topics

I have to keep in mind that sometimes, concise is better. Even I prefer having
the short version of a story instead of fussing with a whole extended form.
Things like time, energy and vetting whether or not if it's worth the previous
two items come into play here. I'm still working on a good way to measure this.

### Breathing and Tweeting

A bit like the separation of topics, sometimes, shit's not worth writing a whole
1,000+ word thing about it. My post tends to average around 600 words[^6] so
short writing is my thing. Tweeting is also. I don't know if there's a tool
since <http://www.howoftendoyoutweet.com/> is down, but I know that I do it too
often and it's mostly manually[^7]. Another site did provide me with some
interesting graphs for the month of September:

{% img "snapshot397.png" %}

I tweet a lot. That's a bit over 25 tweets in an hour if I did in a 8 hour
window.

![Man](/images/snapshot398.png)

This graph is the one I wanted the most: how often I tweeted in relation to
other days. It also exposes my non-conventional sleeping cycle. I take longer
sleeps for close to 4 hours in the evening and attempt to catch naps in the late
evening either around 6pm to 8pm. Without those naps though (and being in this
[freelance state of mind][3]), I tend to wake up about an hour later and thus
nixing chances to catch up on news, go run, etc.

Most of my tweets are just bits and pieces of my personality. I mention this a
lot to people in person but I use Twitter as voraciously as I would engage
in conversation had I been sitting in front of you. Might not be the best means
of the platform's use, but it's an ingrained habit now.

I wouldn't say nor do I think there's enough evidence to say that tweeting has
killed the blogging platform. They exist together and at the moment, Medium has
found a way to bridge the two very nicely. The thing for me now is to figure out
as I tweet:

  * When it's a good idea for me to begin a blog post,
  * If it's a good situation to hash out the post via tweet thread,
  * Sleep more often :grin:.
