The title really says it all. If you stopped a random person in the street, I
can promise you that they have NO idea of how much in common their phone and
Swiss cheese have[^1]. And it's not only phones; it's your house PC, your
laptops[^2], your tablets and [now even your television sets][1]. There's a few
articles on how the NSA and GCHQ actively bust open what I might refer to as
our digital link between people [^3] [^4] [^5] but it's just water over heads
for some. That's okay because if anything, it doesn't immediately affect them
according to public belief[^6]. There's also this idea that if you don't do
anything wrong that you have nothing to hide. [It's yet another silly
stance][2]. And it's kind of something I think that echoes from our legal
system. We've been told by the highest court on the land in the United States
that by default, you're innocent of any crime presented before you unless
[evidence can be produced that proves otherwise][3], _Ei incumbit probatio qui
dicit, non qui negat_ for my legal or Latin friends. Despite this being a valid
precedent, every single American citizen is currently subject to a random search
by the United States government without reason from the NSA or consent from the
person in question[^7]. That has to be bothersome to some of you, _any_ of you.
It doesn't help that local law enforcement have been judge and jury when it
comes to the murder of citizens, namely African American women, children and men
of any age[^10].

Fortunately, there's good people out there actively working against the
government[^8] to do what the government's defense system was meant to do:
defend the People. There's loads of tech and resources out there from people
like the [EFF][4] and [Whisper Systems][5] aimed at making [Web traffic a lot
easier to encrypt][6], [forcing encryption whenever it's available][7] and making
[communication between family and friends more secure][7]. I might have sound
very depressing in the statements above and on social media but it's not
impossible. It's a matter of choice for most people at this point. Either you
willingly allow the government to take control of your devices, which can be
used against you in the future (or edit your history) and harm those close to
you _or_ you can work with people fighting to protect _you_. Regular[^9] people
won't care but that doesn't mean that they don't deserve protection. I'm doing
what I can by starting off with this post and bringing awareness online. What
can you do, _we do_ as a community, continue to do to make these _super dangerous_
issue more important to our community?

[^1]: Holes, man. The Swiss is good for hiding money, but holes.
[^2]: Macbooks are laptops and as of this moment, I refuse to refer to them as the former.

[^6]: This reminds me of a popular dystopia novel I once read.
[^7]: In short, this is being pwn'd in all four dimensions we live in.
[^8]: If I make the government sound evil, it's because they are. Slavery's still legal for inmates and up to the 1940s, Blacks were literally powering the nation.
[^9]: **Regular** is really a bad word to use here, but I'm referring to anyone not interested in technology or cares about technology but makes use of it every day.
