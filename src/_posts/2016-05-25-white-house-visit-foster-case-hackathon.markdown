I'm a bit late to the announcement party but I'll be attending the first ever
[*White House Foster Case and Technology Hackathon*][4] this week on behalf of Clef!
To be honest, I'm a bit nervous about how this'll go down. This brand of nervousness
is the same kind that I've had when I [started a new job][2] and it's only for
two days so it'll wash over soon. I'll be sure to create a Twitter thread based on 
the tweet that blog post originates from.

On the 26th and 27th, the hackathon hosted by the White House, the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, and Think of Us, will focus on tightening bonds between NPO
(non-profit organizations), child welfare leaders and foster care families and alumni,
as well as developers, technologists and leaders from the technology sector. If
you asked me, this was _long_ overdue.

Mad people are going to be there from Slack, [StackOverflow][3], Microsoft, you
name it!
