  Some thoughts about AI, Wintermute and me.

Over the last three years, Wintermute's taught me a lot about what I expected
to learn about artificial intelligence. The biggest takeaway is that it's one
of the biggest moving targets in computer science there is. From speech
synthesis to chess playing mastery, we constantly demote what would classify a
computer as intelligent and push the bar higher for something that'd be
recognized as an embodiment of artificial intelligence. That's a good and bad
thing. It's good because it's driving more and more researches, enthusiasts
and tinkerers into the field. It's bad because for those with less passion, it
can drive them away from the field altogether.

I was taking some time to review some four year old code. Most of it was
related to the earlier form of Wintermute[^1] that was supposed to take the
world by storm. It also included a potential Qt library that'd make it easier
to use PocketSphinx in Qt applications but at the time, I punted on it.
Reviewing that code made me realize how _little_ I actually knew I knew about
the field and how much further I had to go today. I don't see it as a mistake
or a misstep. I'm actually really glad I made all of these wild assumptions
about the world, that one could just load an file loaded with Web ontology
references, smack together a part-of-speech tagger and automatically have
binaries that could understand the English I rolled into it. To a point, it
worked. I managed to get the phrase "We are boys" correctly tagged using the
[grammar][1] and [node][2] rules over weeks of tweaking. But that was weeks of
unaided, mostly experimenting and tweaking of said rules and referencing to
books I had here on English grammar typically used for writing. That went only
so far before I kind of gave up and got a full-time job that prohibited me
from spending a lot of time on things like this.

Like I mentioned, this was a good stepping stone for me and actually had me
realize that the field of study I was most interested in for artificial
intelligence was the one that related to linguistics[^2]. I like it since it's
part of a routine of everyday life; speaking and interpreting messages using
phonemes and symbols, it's amazing and almost impossible for human history to
persist without it. So from a stance, you'd see me diving quite deeply into
the world of natural language processing and computational linguistics.

To say that I'm an "expert" when it comes to artificial intelligence would be
discrediting the works of Minsky and the likes, the cats who gave us the
algorithms, theorems and basis of thought for what we use as AI on the
regular. Labelling myself as an enthusiast that's willing to learn a shit ton
more is definitely more up my alley. And if there's one way I've managed to
learn things, it's been via tinkering, breaking and building.

[^1]: I was CRAZY. Like bat-shit crazy. I really thought I could build something on par with JARVIS at the time.
[^2]: It's significant since my brother's currently studying this, but not from a computer science standpoint.
