**[#HackHarlem][1]** happened one Saturday in March and it was dope. Despite all
of the events happening out here in New York regarding diversity, it was amazing
to see a Black-run, Black-judged and Black-focused hackathon. **Representation
matters a lot**. The goal of the hackathon was to have local technologists
brainstorm, discuss and hash together drafts and ideas that can be used to
enhance the livelihood of the residents of Harlem. Not even being from Harlem,
this hackathon touched close to home. Software that helps communities
**helps people**; especially in communities that are being socially,
economically and to an extent _mentally_ attacked[^1]. Anything to make the
lives of the residents easier is a plus (I'm looking at you, MTA).

Nothing but dope ideas came out of the hackathon that weekend and I'm hoping
that people still continue on with their ideas[^2]. I'm guilty of leaving two
Black-centric hacks in my dusty `~/code` folder :sob:. This post serves as a
micro-affirmation to complete said hacks and make them into (hopefully) evolving
projects that I can show to others to encourage one another to **KeepOnHacking
:trademark:**.

People came up with ideas like a cost-sensitive dietary platform to help
low-income families eat healthy, a discovery tool that'd look up vendors
supporting SNAP/EBT with community ratings and even the digitization of a
pre-existing (for more an decade) Harlem tour service! Shoot, if I had a few
grand to hand out, I couldn't see a better way to help people than with these
ideas! After all, technology's mean to enhance life (I'm looking at you, YC).

If there's one thing I want people to know about [#HackHarlem][1], it was that
it was a grassroots event. It was run by people who lived in Harlem, attended
(mostly) by Harlem residents and the ideas all came out with the intent of
aiding Harlem residents. Before anyone decides to complain about "oh, what about
me?", I'm from **Brooklyn**, if [you didn't know][2]. I didn't complain about
inclusion here because this moment wasn't about me (or Brooklyn). If I really
wanted it that badly, I could have hit up a few people to get stuff going down
in the Heights or over in the Stuy. But Brooklyn has a tech scene. Harlem
**needs** its scene to grow, but in the opposite way that Brooklyn's scene grew,
by the _people_; not its colonizers[^4].

That's my $0.02, though. I'm excited for the next **[#HackHarlem][1]**. If
you're an engineer and you're looking to make good of your skillset, it's the
place to be.
