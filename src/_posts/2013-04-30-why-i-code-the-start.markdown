  Explaining the story of how I got introduced to software engineering and
  computer programming.

---

I don't really know when I started. I typically tell people 2006 only
because that's when I started to use tools designed for programming
instead of just Notepad and Internet Explorer.

And also because it's when I began tinkering with compiled languages,
specifically C++. All of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript I knew was done mostly
through experimentation and a lot of searching the Web. My father noticed my
'extreme' (as he put it) interest in programming and gave me his introductory
C++ programming textbook from class. The disc came with Visual Studio 2005 and
to this day, I have to applaud the comprehensive nature of Visual Studio. The
IDE gave me a foundation good enough to grow as a language learner. I started
from the front of the textbook and did as many problems as I could. Going back
and revisiting some cases presented in the book allowed me to grow a bit with
each turn. Eventually, I couldn't learn any more from the book. It was, after
all, an introductory course, and my father didn't have any more books.

By this time, it was about 2008. Again, these thoughts and moments evade
me but I remember reading somewhere about the world of software and the
open source nature of things. It was divided (so I thought) down the middle
between open and closed source software. That was how I came across the open
source operating system [Ubuntu][]. It looked very easy to use and it didn't
seem to require too many work to keep it going. I downloaded the system into an
CD image on the house machine and tried it in VirtualBox. I was stunned that
this stuff was out there and no one informed me. The menu layout, panels,
widgets, everything had me fall more and more in love with not only Ubuntu but
open source technologies as a whole. I believe it was in the month of August of
2010 that I finally and fully adopted open source technology for every aspect of
life in tech.

**That was the start.**
