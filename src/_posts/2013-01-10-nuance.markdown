Just about the turn of the new year, a few [friends][sii] of mine decided to start
a nifty little project. It was planned (and still is) to be the biggest thing in
any of our lives.

I was one of the first developers and another lad, __Dante Ashton__, led the
product design and implementation. I must admit, we were well over our heads with
this project but we did what we could and began to design and program out as much
as we could for the application. Back in late 2010, early 2011, we had a server
spinning and bent to our will. We had an instance of Bugzilla up and running and
doing what we wanted to. We were working hard to attempt to understand what no one
else did. We did it in an __open__ fashion. We put all of our research in
a __centralialized__ place.

At CES 2013, Nuance Corporation demonstrated an internal version of a project
quite similar to ours. So similar to a point where it has the same exact name.
Something like that could be expected, whomever read the book "[Neuromancer][]"
will not only be connected to the name __Wintermute__. The project was named
[Wintermute][] with its initial sister project [SpeechControl][].
Its sister project was meant to pave a way for speech recognition friendliness
on Linux. Yes, __Linux__. I've been a open source advocate for as long as my `~/.bash_history` can go and I use Ubuntu for server and desktop purposes. I
figured that since it's a desktop that's malleable to no end, why not adapt it
even more? This thought and many others in human-computer
interfacing of the KDE and Unity desktop to light.

I only ask, Nuance, why didn't you ask us before going ahead and using that name
in your project? I mean, sure, we're just a few teens and adults scattered
across the globe trying to build up a far-fetched yet possible idea. But still
there's that common decency aspect. As a software developer, this is a bit
daunting. Having a company whose primary (if not sole) focus is speech
recognition, we don't really stand a chance (for now, at least). I hope
that in coming days, Nuance and the Synthetic Intellect Institute would be
able to stand side by side, and not butt heads in attempting to provide
innovative tools in the speech recognition space.

> P.S: We did have a P.R. release of the project, if curious.
> [Akshat over at OMG!Ubuntu][pr] did a nice job of covering us.
> Hope you enjoy it.
