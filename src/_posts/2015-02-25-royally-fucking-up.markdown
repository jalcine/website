I fuck up a lot. More often than I'd care to admit but it happens often enough
when I've begun to question whether or not software engineering is a viable
career strategy for me. I really enjoy the (relative) malleability of computers;
the ability to literally build anything you want on a two-dimensional screen is
empowering. One can take it a step further and use prototypical electronics like
Arduino or the Raspberry Pi and make some really cool stuff. But that's not the
point. That's more of the "fun" stuff, the "oh! shiny!" kind of things. I know
about 4 people who gets paid and taxed to work on this kind of stuff on a daily
basis and plainly put, that leads to a bit of envy. Still not the point, though.

When I get wrapped up in a personal project, be it [Wintermute][] or [Oa][], I
get _too_ wrapped up. Like I've spent days working on it, in and out, just
tweaking and hoping for optimal performance. I had two client jobs whose
deadlines I had to extend because I put my own projects before theirs. And
that's wrong[^1]. It was selfish and I needed to realize that timing clientèle
work as managing my side projects is going to be tricky if the two don't relate.
That'd be easy if the day job wasn't focused on Web design and the night hobbies
entailed divulging deeper into C++14.

The tales and tribulations, I suppose. I'm not going to always pose a rosy entry
here since it's supposed to be a reminder to me before anything else of the
things that I've done, am working on and have experienced. So yeah; this
definitely isn't the last post of its kind.
