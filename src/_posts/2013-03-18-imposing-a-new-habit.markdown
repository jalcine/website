I have been working to improve my habits this week and so far, this has been
proved to be productive. I've managed to get a bit of an early morning workout
including a full body stretch so I'm feeling good. After I [check off some
tasks](http://any.do) and get some music going, I can begin working on some
personal projects and open source work. Happy Monday!

I've been trying to write this post a few times. Clumsy me, I dropped my 
laptop on the floor while I was in my bed and I finally decided to flip it 
over and check what was happening inside. I found [something interesting](http://instagram.com/p/W_uBftnPr0/) 
and fixed it right after.

The new habit I'm working towards is focused heavily on productivity. Using 
Any.Do and with heavy calendar use, I should be able to accomplish all of the 
work I have set out for myself. At the end of the week, I'll also try to provide
a recap and determine what I'm lacking in. What's y our weekly mission
statement?
