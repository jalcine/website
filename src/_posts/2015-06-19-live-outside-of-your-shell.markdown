I started writing this on the 4 local train after hanging out with a few people from
an event held post-[CSSConf 2015][1]. Seeing all of these new and old faces as
well as faces I recognized by handles or 60 by 60 pixel images[^5] on the
Internet had me feeling a bunch of different feelings at once[^1]. I didn't have
the time nor attend CSSConf in person and that's completely okay; life does
shit like that. But getting the chance to reconnect with a bunch of people did
help the funk I was feeling in light of events in the States. I initially told
myself I wasn't going to go outside unless it dealt with work and speaking to my
younger brother; I had to change my mind on that. He mentioned that I always had
a story to tell about how my time outside went and that me being in a lot or
just on the roof didn't lead to this.

Since I've parted ways with my last full-time position and ended up turning down
_a lot_ of positions[^2] because of potential conflicts with vibes of the
company's culture. Though not conclusive, you can ask particular questions to
engineers about how out-going they'll be if you were to attempt to actually
solve a problem with them. This, more or less, convinced me that going back to
freelancing, for now, was the best solution for sanity and a level of comfort.
Doing so though, caused a lack of interactivity with people that I did enjoy
while working; a human-esque, lax-on-work, more-bonding element. I could
crack a joke, mention something interesting I've found that's not necessarily
tech related and feel a bit alive at this place I spent most of my time at.

Just being out of the house, not working on anything in particular outside of
meeting people and connecting with people felt really _really_ good. Like "can I
have four more of these?" kind of good. It made me feel so good I managed to
write this blog post about it, heh. I degraded my experience by using social
media, specifically Twitter, to supplement that interactivity. I've made some
awesome acquaintances online and it was even better meeting the select group
that I did in person. As much as we'd try, nothing[^3] can supplement the
comfortableness of sharing thoughts over a beer or tea (whichever suits your
fancy; I'm in both camps actually).

What I'm trying to say, if I'm saying anything at all, is that you need to go
outside once in a while. I'd understand if anxiety prevents you and I'm not
trying to get a forklift to shove you out. But getting around people more often
than less helps ease tension. This is coming from someone who can't go concerts
because of paranoia of large crowds[^4]. I can only really go if I'm with and
like surrounded by people I know and trust. I'm probably ranting by now, but I
hope that this gets to someone who needs it.

**I know I did.** Thanks, Will.
