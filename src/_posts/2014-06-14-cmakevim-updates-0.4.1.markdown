Firstly, I have to apologize to the users of `cmake.vim` who received
near-terrible performance with version 0.3.x. I was struggling to understand
how I could parse CMake information without slowing down Vim too much; but that
proved to be just a Vim problem. I'm steadfast on making this a Vimscript-only
plugin so that it's relatively cross-platform.

I've had a bit of help making patches to the application and with these
changes, [`0.4.1`][cmake] is the best yet! Please, if you notice any bugs 
and/or issues, feel free to report them and give as much detail as you can!
