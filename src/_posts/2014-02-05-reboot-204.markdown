Like the new look? It's the first in a major revamping I'm doing of my
personal identity across the Web. In lieu of my want to constantly push out my
ideas and projects to the world, I figured that I would use the first result
that comes up for me in search results. The biggest thing to note is that
everything is **lavender**! It's a color that oddly resonates deeply with me
and I picked it over navy and black (shades of gray).

Some things I plan to address are mainly computer programming ones, pertaining
closely to the use of and writing of software for the Web and potentially
mobile as well. I'm an Rails and Symfony application developer now but I'm
venturing slowly into Android development out of deep interest of having more
power over my mobile devices. I'm also picking up time to work on my personal
hacks like Wintermute and `KIO::Cloud` so expect updates about these in the
coming weeks.

Unfortunately, I have to delay the release of the app I was planning to push
to the Play Store; as I'm working to make it easier to deploy 'nightly
builds'. But do be on the lookout for such a post of mine mentioning an app in
my Google+ stream.

Lightly said, I'm turning this up and bringing Jacky back into the
blogosphere, although it's insanely crowded now; but that's a post!
