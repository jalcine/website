I'm writing this after I've sent my brother off to school and getting ready to
awaken another for class. These guys give me pain like none other but I
wouldn't trade it for the world. Whenever I'm not working, be it in an office,
co-working place or from my desk, I'm paying these cats back for every minute
of trouble they give. One of my brothers is beyond fanatical with how the MTA manages
to be running 24/7[^1] and the other isn't too sure what he's interested in.
I'm glad that I had the chance to show them how words on a screen can turn into
what both of them may like[^2]. When it comes to helping others outside of the
family though, I really do what I think I'm capable of doing for them. That
never seems to be exactly what people expect me to do; and I think it's a
little bit on how I was raised.

My parents had a very interesting concept of helping my brothers and sister
out. One time, I fell hard in the playground back in junior high and messed up
my uniform pants. My mom took a look and had me accompany her to her room where
she'd show me how to sew the tear in the pants. I complained about having to
wear the torn pants again so I avoided that pair as much as I could. But, lo
and behold, more of my pants got torn[^3].
