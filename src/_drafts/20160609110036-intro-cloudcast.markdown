A while back, I mentioned the idea of using [Soundcloud][] as a storage backend for
podcasts to a friend on Twitter (hi Bo!):

Now, if you don't already have a service for podcasting and you don't mind
spending $12 a month for the service, I know quite a few people who use
[Simplecast][] and are content! However, a large portion of the podcasts I end
up listening to are stored on Soundcloud. That, coupled with the fact that I
don't have Soundcloud installed on my Android or iOS devices makes it a bit
complicated for listening. The services _does_ provide a means of connecting a
[SoundCloud account to iTunes for podcasting][1], but I don't use iTunes on my
Linux laptop. Coupled with the fact that Soundcloud has a dedicated but 
implicit [portal for podcasting][2] behind a pay wall (for the content
producers), most of these services don't make it easy for me to import
the content into something like [gpodder][] or [Amarok][].

## Building from Nothing

[Iheanyi][]'s mentioned the awesomeness of [Ember][] a lot and I decided that
this project would be a good opportunity to work on something new. I managed to
get the base of the application up and going up using that platform quite
easily. I also managed to put what I learned about ES6 to use.

## Refining the Platform

{% comment %} Chat about how the UI was refined to make it more simple. {% endcomment %}

## Building A Community

{% comment %}
  * Mention how Buffer was used to allow people to share information across platforms.
  * Mention the ability for users to share and subscribe to their favorite podcasts.
  * Mention efficient support for Facebook, Twitter and Tubmlr via oEmbed tools.
{% endcomment %}

## Future Ambitions

{% comment %}
  * Mention the potential of allowing audio to be uploaded directly to break
    from Soundcloud.
  * Consider implementing an API that one can use to build client applications.
  * Consider launching the Android application.
