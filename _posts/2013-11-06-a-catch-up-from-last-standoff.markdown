Recording your thoughts, opinions and ideas is helpful for everyone. It helps
you personally because those thoughts are now off your head and in a format
you can easily search, index and pull up later. It helps others so they don't
have *you directly* what you think of certain topics you choose to speak on.
That's what this blog is supposed to serve as; a medium to express my
thoughts, opinions and ideas in a readily available format. However, I've been
slacking hard when it came to writing new entries; I wanted a new one every
week. I'm getting slowly back into that habit, but I have to catch up the blog
with past events.

# Tizen

[Tizen][] is a fun thing. Ask me about it in the street and I'll ask to change
the conversation. I don't really support the glorification of proprietary
systems[^1] and telling me that Tizen is an open source project is like
telling me peanut butter won't trigger allgeric reactions in someone who has
anaphylaxis. The goals and ambitions behind these projects are completely
wasted when we already have robust solutions out here that would have not only
worked but insured a better user adoption than rolling your own solution. Two
projects I'd point to are both the [Ubuntu Unity][] and [Plasma Active][]
hybrid device initiatives. But when you have the money to hire a legion of
developers and what not; things happen.

I have a [Samsung RP-DQ][rpdq], a developer reference device provided by
Samsung to assist cats like moi in making applications for Tizen. I'm going to
start this off by saying; it was annoying frustating to set up the environment
for this on Linux. Android was incredibly easy compared to this and I'm
talking Eclipse days. I still have a hard time building applications for this
device mainly because I can't use existing tools for it. And that's extremely
sad. Samsung and Intel really need to quit this "reinventing" of the wheel.
Intel's focus on mobile should be in the hands of the community but again,
money is where the "innovation" is going to be.

# Work

My day job as a full-stack web developer got extended into my evening life
since now I've taken up a venture that'd be exciting to explain in coming
days. I've also begun reading up more on getting more work done in communities
that I'd choose to involve myself with like the [KDE][] environments and
[Qt][] as a whole. Web development is going to be very Ruby on Rails for me
until I can comfortably transition into either Go or Node.js; it's a matter of
being willing to build the tools that you'd need. That attribute is what fuels
good developers to be even better. There's a problem with this code? Dive down
that stack and see why it happens. Report a bug. *FIX THE BUG*. It's not easy
but the best things in life require a bit of a bump and grind.

I do have some ideas for projects I'd like to work on and complete. Firstly
would be (yet another) drafting of Wintermute, my personal attempt at a
networked intelligent application framework. Each day I'm learning more and
more that could help me work on finalizing a 0.1 release of the darn thing.
Also, I've been keeping my eye on this Qt-based login manager called [SDDM][].
It'd easily replace Canonical's LightDM (which is riddled with CLAs) and would
make it so much more awesome in terms of designing and adding new themes for
logging in. I also have a few patches for [Choqok][], a Twitter client I use
on KDE that I have to clean up for code review. It'd be great if this was
refactored to be more of a Qt-based application as opposed as to being so
KDE-orientated for cross-desktop support but right now, I'm loving it!

# Next

Good chance, I'll be at this blogging thing again. Expect a new design of the
site in the new few posts and more focused posts on specific topics. I don't
add many, but photos are going to be front-and-center as well as code snippets
for relating posts.

[^1]: Tizen is NOT an open source project. Do your homework. Android is more
open. Darwin (the basis of OS X) is more open. Tizen is *not* open.
