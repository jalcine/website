I replied applied for a job as a front-end developer at a pretty amazing
digital agency in SoHo, NYC. Meeting with the lead developer, I already loved
the potential environment that I could have immersed myself in for days at a
time. To complete the first round of the process, a code test was presented.

Pretty (reasonable)[^1] (and quite standard) in the tech community for
figuring out a developer's prowess. About a few days later, I called in
to ask about the position. I was turned away because I "overengineered".
I was disheartened not because I was turned
away per se, but more for to the reason of the such. I didn't think that
I pushed too hard for the project. It was a simple landing page that collected
a few fields from the user. The UX was built from slicing up a PSD but outside
of that, it was simple.

When I did hear the alternative (solution)[^2], I noticed something very
important. In order for me to continue going down this route as a front-end
developer, I have to remember that I don't need frameworks let alone
management tools to (GSD)[^1]. The application could have been easily built by
hacking up a page using HAML and then writing a quick-n-dirty PHP script to
handle the rest.

The means to a solution doesn't make it the correct one. Sometimes just
getting the shit done easy and cleanly is just the better way to go.
**Pro-tip:** don't over-do it and build a full-blown SaaS. Just open up
TextEdit with a `.htm` file and call it a day.

[^1]: I'll expand in a future post about it.
[^2]: My solution was using Silex for rendering a simple language page and
  handle the work of using Campaign Monitor to collect e-mail addresses. The
  solution provided was using a fully built HTML page and then having a
  lighter backend tool to handle the logistics.
[^3]: "get shit done", because things are for kids.
