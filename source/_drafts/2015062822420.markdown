I've classified myself over the last few months as a [**Haitian Black**][1]
individual as opposed to being an African American. I initially challenged this
idea early 2014 when I wanted to really understand what my background was but
not necessarily who I am; more about the people that came before and right up my
moment of existence. My parents and grandparents were all born in Haiti, with
the exception of my mother's mother being born in the Dominican Republic. All of
which, sans my mother's mother, has a overwhelming amount of African ancestry,
given one were to date all of the way back to colonial dates of Hispaniola.

The whole intent behind this self-identification is two-fold: to help me
_remember who brought me here_ and where I feel _I should go to help_ advance things
in the future for my people. The latter is more personal than I'd rather care to
blog about but the former is something more important than most lead on. I think
that for me, not having a sense of belonging to a place made me a bit of a
unwilling nomad, travelling with some sort of an idea of where I should end up.
