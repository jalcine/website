Once again, I was sitting and almost sleeping while reading about using finite
state automata to determine two-phase morphology for a given word. I was kind of
thinking about how dope the last [#BlerdChat on Twitter][1] was **lit**. I
haven't participated in a chat like that since the last Black comics chat (I
don't remember when it was) and I liked it a lot! This gave me the idea that
hundreds of people probably have of creating a tool that makes it easy to
administer and handle Twitter chats. The thing with searching is that it's
currently not intuitive to pull up a search query like the one I did without
even knowing that the advanced section exists. Also, being able to highlight
certain tweets as a moderator allows for more visibility to interesting content
and makes for an excellent means for pulling up older tweets when interesting in
making a post or media expose on the event.

## Sketching It Out

As every Web designer might do, I pulled up my notebook and began doodling how I
wanted this to work in my head. The look is equivalent to the function, which
should be implicit. The first page that I worked on was the active chat room
which is probably going to be the most used pages by users. It looks like this:

{% comment %} Take picture and add here. {% endcomment %}

The page is sparse but after taking that and making a static page mockup with
some sample data, it looks a bit like this (yay for WebM!)

{% comment %} Record page using Backbone to emulate traffic. {% endcomment %}

So there's that. This took me a week and change to hammer down into this level
of detail.
