I've gotten the parts of Wintermute that I've wanted to iron out down pat. The
core C++ library is about 75% tested and it handles its two primary plugins
okay enough for me to consider moving to the next steps. This steps involves a
few things. Building a "driver", or an executable that can load plugins and have
them operate on their own is one part of the step. That's going to be relatively
easy, since it's just reading options from the command line and working
accordingly; a shell of sorts. The tricker part would be binding Wintermute to
another language, Ruby in particular. It might be been a bit simple to do if it
was done using C from what I'm seeing but challenges are for seizing.

Why does this matter so much? Well, Wintermute's not a project I'd want to have
me stuck in C++ if I want to do a lot of prototyping and experimenting between
the datasets different plugins provide; Ruby's excellent for that. Thus, the
creation of the [Ruby gem for Wintermute][1]. I took a lot of notes from
[nokogiri][2][^1]

[^1]: No, seriously, I don't think that there could be a better real world example of a native C++ gem. Thank y'all!
