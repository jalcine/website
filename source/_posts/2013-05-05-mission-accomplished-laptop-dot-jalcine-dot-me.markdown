For about a month or so, my laptop was out of working order due to an issue 
with the DC jack. That's the part of the laptop's motherboard that takes power 
from your laptop charger cable to your battery, thus keeping your laptop up 
and running. <!-- more --> Me thinking of the cheapest and more educational route, I decided 
to order a new motherboard for it. I own a [ASUS K53E-BBR27 laptop](http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/K53e),
so I ordered a replacement board. I learned quite a few things about laptops 
and their internals when I replaced the board.

 + When servicing your own machines for the first time, you will almost end up 
   with "extra" screws. I've had this happen to me too many times during the 
   numerous times I've opened up my bad boy and took him around town. I had to 
   upgrade my [WLAN card](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QXLIWI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to incorporate bluetooth
   instead of me having to use a dongle. I also increased my RAM to 8GB thanks 
   to the ever nifty [4GB DDR3 RAM card](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YU83YO/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), thus
   giving my laptop some more thinking space.

 + The CPU of a computer is a LOT smaller than you'd expect. I [held it in my hand](http://instagram.com/p/Y5PaWCnPg7/) 
   and I couldn't get around how this was the symbol of innovation in our day 
   and age. And they get even smaller yet pack even more power. It's really 
   amazing how these things work! I had to remove it from the old board and 
   move it to the new board, for some reason, I assumed the new board to come 
   with a new CPU (whomp whomp).

 + Cleaning the internal components of your laptop make it less noisy (if it 
   makes noise). My laptop rarely makes sound (from places other than the 
   speakers), but I've found that after dusting out the fan and cleaning down 
   the chassis a cleaner and smoother experience. If it doesn't have to work 
   hard to cool itself down and move dust out, it's a happy camper.

There's one thing for certain, this entire process of having to service my 
laptop by hand has further deepen my want to get more into hobby engineering, 
especially since it's become very "noob" friendly in recent days. This will be 
most likely how I spend a considerable amount of my time in the summer; 
working on PCBs and understanding how to reprogram them to follow a will.
