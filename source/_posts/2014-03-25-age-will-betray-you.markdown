Let's start this off a bit imaginative. You've been a car accident and you're
losing loads of blood. You have two fractured ribs and your vision's blurring.
In another moment, you're in the back of an ambulance being driven
franctically to the nearest hospital. You look to your left, to the person
treating you and realize that they're old enough to be worrying about college
placement exams. Do you panic in fear that you might be in underqualified
hands or do you attempt to make do with what you have?

Though a bit graphic of an example, the message conveyed is clear: **age can
be the leading, if not a pivotal, factor in a lot of decision making**. It can bar
otherwise-brilliant people from places that could evolve in or prevent those
requiring the necessary training to grow from obtaining it. There is a bit of
an evolutionary aspect to things, having them learn on their own, but we've
mitigated the need for that when we started using medicine. I say we because
there's been times I couldn't attend particular events purely out of an age
restriction or discrimination.

I don't know how we can fix this aside from preventing it being trickled down
the generational pipeline of society. It sucks, but it comes with how we do
education as well, I think. It's something that's being banging around in my
head. I try to treat my siblings with the level of intellectual compassion as
I would want to be treated myself and it works out fairly well.
