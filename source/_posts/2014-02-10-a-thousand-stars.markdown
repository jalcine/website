At the time of writing, I follow **838 people** on GitHub. That's almost as
many people as I follow on Twitter (that being 1,286) but that's *a bit*
sensible. I'm a bit of a stickler for social interactivity, be it in person or
on the Web. GitHub allows me to not only watch the ebb and flow of software
(and hardware!) projects but I can watch as a particular repository becomes
more popular and gain traction; indirectly giving me enough reason to pick it
for scrutiny.

While this may prove to be a bit weird for those who don't really follow code,
I've been looking to saturate my knowledge of language style and project
management by watching how people react to things on GitHub. For example, the
ever [famous comment][] between @fat and @douglascrockford is enough to
have one take a bit of retrospect when it comes to what is actually an
authoritative source of a language's syntax (hint: no one).

Another reason for my personal glimpses into people's coding habits is
checking out their system configuration. More commonly known as [dotfiles][],
these files define the shell interactivity and can go as far as to define the
ebb and flow of your user on your operating system. I have my [own dotfiles][]
stashed on GitHub and it's made it a lot easier to share my shell's
configuration across multiple machines, be it in Vagrant, my laptop or a
remote server. Making your shell more faster is like improving your reflexes;
and doing the same for applications you use everyday is just working on top of
that. I recommend taking a look at your `~/.profile`, `~/.vimrc` and the likes.
Check out how your everyday tools work to see placements for improvements and
optimizations and look to use this to make you a better shell user.
