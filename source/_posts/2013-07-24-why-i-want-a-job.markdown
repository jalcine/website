At the time of writing, I'm unemployed. My [LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/jackyalcine) 
says otherwise, but I'm slowly squeezing out my savings as we speak. 
Being twenty and still living with your parents has its ups 
(and its downs, oh man the downs). But it's definitely about time 
I got my hands wet with something I'd want to work on.

Before I continue, I have to admit, I had two opporunities to work in some
established startups. The only problem was my lack of knowledge of certain
paradigms like the [Facade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) or
the reason why Node.js seems to be such a magical god-send.

Nowadays, I've been urged to join a fellowship of sorts, first the
[Theil Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/),
[Hacker School](www.hackerschool.com), and a few others. I turned them down
out of a lack of a big idea idea I was willing to turn into a lucrative
business. That's not my end-goal, to make money off of people. I want to make
some kickass software that's inseparable, something that makes you wish that
you made it yourself!

At the same time, I don't have those skills. I don't have the necessary
knowledege to build stuff at the speed of demigods building kernels for the
hell of it. I'm still a developer-in-training and that's why I'd want training
in a bit of a stressful, deadline-paced environment, aka, a workplace.
