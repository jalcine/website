It's been one whole (working) week since I've been at Shutterstock and it's
been great! If there's one thing I was anticipating (and had my hands crossed
for), it was the lack of using a specific language to do everything. One thing
I've noticed over my last few meet ups here in NYC and what I've gathered from
people who work in larger tech companies is typically that whichever language
has the best paradigms and tools to solve a particular problem *efficently*
would most likely be the first one used. Of course; until someone builds one
in-house. Shutterstock embraces a lot of technology as mentioned on their [open
source technologies][ostsstk] page and it's done in a variety of languages for
different aspects of the site.

I don't know for sure if I can explicitly mention what I'm working on (good
chance I can't) so I won't even push the barometer. What I will do is probably
continue writing about topics about personal work and things that I had to a
double take to get. Until then!
