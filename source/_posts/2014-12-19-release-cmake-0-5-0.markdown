I'm glad to announce that [version `0.5.0`][re] of my plugin for Vim,
[`cmake.vim`][cmakevim] has been released! It's a heavily tested, gut-torn-out
rewrite of the plugin and is ready for the public to use. The goal of this
plugin was for complete integration of the [CMake][] build configuration tool
within Vim and accompanying plugins like [YouCompleteMe][], [Syntastic][] and
make use of the features that other programs like [ctags][] had to offer
without too much heavy wiring into Vim. It _should_ be an plug-and-play
solution. Fortunately, if it's not, feel free to [report your issue][bugs] and
get it cracking.

I'm still working on [Syntastic support in a pull request][sypr] so anyone can
chime in and add their two cents to things. Glad that this was pushed out,
CMake and Vim needed one another. Again, yay!
