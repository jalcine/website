I track my reading habits using [reading.am][] and occasionally, I work on
providing a week review of the things I've read here with a short blurb. This is
my way of writing a _really short_ book report but not for books and definitely
not a report. [Check out my previous (also first) entry!][prev]

### [Some Initial Thoughts][link:1] by Josh Marshall

I didn't follow too closely to the debates (I rarely do); I tend to read recaps
and not spend time watching, in _real time_, people not giving a shit about my
existence but yet still want me to contribute to theirs. `</rant>`. This however:

> Even if Trump collapses over the next few weeks, when we look back on this race,
> I think it will be clear that in various ways over several weeks, Donald Trump
> destroyed Bush's candidacy.

That is something I've noticed from reviewing the points slung from either
party. Something else we already knew:

> On balance, not a dominating night for Trump. But I think he maintained a hold on the
> issue that is driving his success: xenophobia and extreme hostility to immigrants.

Can Trump even do that? :confounded:

### [Google Is 2 Billion Lines of Code—And It’s All in One Place][link:2] by Wired

**Wat** :frowning:.

WHAT?

Bruh. In short:

![An explosion with a smoke cloud.](/images/bomb.gif)

To be honest, this is an interesting view point with the whole explosion of
micro-services nowadays. I figure that people would store the logic in separate
trees but it seems like it's going to be a central tree that handles everything
but can be used to invoke specific parts when necessary. The latter is the
approach I'm taking for a personal project.

### [Your First Job May Not Be Your Dream Job][link:3] by Treehouse

Yeah, we need to un-plug from the over hype of Silicon Valley, man.

> It’s not the end of the world.

I need this to be told to me after _every_ interview. You put all of
your faith, effort and hopes into this interview only to get a 'no'. It's beyond
disheartening.

> You’re not expected to work there all your life, a year under your belt is
> enough experience for other employers. It's perfectly acceptable to move on
> after a year. 

This little difference in software companies from traditional companies is
something that's hard to translate to people in other fields or transitioning
in. "I don't have to stay? Why did I join?" I'd say **to learn** and **grow**.

## Physical Publications

I didn't read **any physical books** this week :sob:! It has been solely an
web article and podcast heavy week. I'm going to have to skip some episodes
of upcoming ones and stick my head back into books from last week.

That's it for this week. I take suggestions for things to read very openly via
email or Twitter. Let's see if I can keep this up :running:!
