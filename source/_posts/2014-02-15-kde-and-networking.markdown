If you haven't noticed from previous screen shots in my weblog, I use [KDE][1] as
my desktop environment of choice. Aside from Chrome, I use mostly KDE software
for my desktop work. It has a really great way of not only working out of the
box, but the feedback and updates (every month!) are great too. I might also
like it a lot too since a lot of the code base is written with C++.

## Peer Discovery

Whenever you connect to a new network on Windows (XP SP2 and greater, I think,
and specifically a wireless network, I haven't tried Ethernet connections),
it asks for the network type. Now, some might disregard this window,
but this determines the amount of information that the platform should
expose the new network. If you're a casual Linux user with no real tinkering,
not much about your system is ever visible over the network. However, software
like Samba, ZeroConf/Avahi and others can eventually a bit of a hassle to constantly
switch on and off.

Using Avahi to look at my local network over ZeroConf, I get a bit of
interesting information:
{% highlight bash %}
# You must have `avahi` installed for this to work on your machine.
# sudo apt-get install kde-zeroconf (for KDE).
$ avahi-browse -a
+  wlan0 IPv6 Jacky Alcine@neuromancer            iChat Presence         local
+  wlan0 IPv4 Jacky Alcine@neuromancer            iChat Presence         local
+  wlan0 IPv6 saned                               _sane-port._tcp        local
+  wlan0 IPv4 saned                               _sane-port._tcp        local
+  wlan0 IPv6 neuromancer [dc\:85:\de:\52:\29:d1] Workstation            local
+  wlan0 IPv4 neuromancer [dc\:85:\de:\52:\29:d1] Workstation            local
+  wlan0 IPv6 neuromancer                         Remote Disk Management local
+  wlan0 IPv4 neuromancer                         Remote Disk Management local
```
{% endhighlight %}

Above, you can see my local network chat capabilities (via iChat or Adium 
for OS X and [Telepathy IM][3] on KDE), `sane` used for discovering scanners, 
machine discovery and `udisk` abstraction so I can publish drives over Avahi.
Talk about some nifty tech! Thing is, I'd have to manually turn these things
on and off in order to get them hidden from other users. Maybe I don't want
to want my local chat presence to be visible in some networks but I'd rather
it to be shown when I'm in others. All of the functionality and logic to
create "network profiles", or per-network configuration blocks for
applications is here.

## Information Sharing

Now, the concept of just finding other laptops can be annoying. But it's
definitely useful if you don't want to drop a file into Dropbox or Google
Drive just to share (and it's faster). Sometimes just using tools like Samba
(on Linux for access to file servers on other Linux, OS X and Windows
machines) would do. I've always found this to be the best way to send files
quickly especially if you don't want to slow down potential network speeds.
KDE does have an way of incorporating this, but so far it seems to be
only with Samba, for the moment.

I'm working to bring other remote document storage solutions like Dropbox and
Google Drive natively into KDE using KIO so it's something to look forward
to in coming months. The code will be available on its 0.1 release sometime in
March.

## Security

Though not installed by default, the KDE configuration module (known as KCM)
for UFW (uncomplicated firewall) is a straight forward tool to setting up and
getting ufw on your system. I have to admit, though, it isn't really friendly
for novice users; it could make do with some template profiles and I've
considered patching it for just this purpose. But outside of that, I can
provide the profile I [use for those interested](/files/kcm_ufw_default.ufw).

It's a old wife's tale about Linux not getting viruses and trojans but it
doesn't happen enough to the casual desktop user of Linux or BSD (given our growing
size) to not be safe. With `clamav`, one can stay relatively secure and
prevent their systems from known infection streams.

When it comes to networking, KDE does it right. KIO is fantastic for
abstracting network resources as a local file system and the use of Avahi and
Samba only further enhances that.
