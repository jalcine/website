It sucks to say this but it wasn't *un*expected. After reading this [lengthy
article from Ars Technica][androidars], it's clear that Google is finishing
up what it intended; to firmly place its software and enhancements ahead of
the community and completely rejecting its initial stance of providing a
state-of-the-art AOSP code-base. Technically, the code for most projects as
mentioned in the link have gone to **abandonware** state, which is enough to
make one wonder if using "stock" Android is going to be a viable thing
nowadays. Unknowingly, we've become subject to a similar walled garden issue
that most iOS and OS X users (willingly) subject themselves to. The image from
the Ars Technica link below shows Samsung replacing Google in order to give
users a life outside of Google.

For a person who just uses Android for the hell of it, this is actually more
of a blessing than anything else. This allows Google to build better versions
of the core applications and ensure delivery of these updates across the
devices that are powered by Google Play. However, devices like Samsung's
future release of the Galaxy line and other vendors that aren't part of the
Open Handset Alliance (aka Google's little handset kingdom) aren't going to
be able to provide users with these niceties and thus have to resort to
either hand-building applications from AOSP or moving to another platform.

This is where things like [Ubuntu Touch][ubuntu] and [Plasma Active][pls] come
into play. These are purely open operating systems for mobile devices and
they'd work anywhere Debian Linux can. But hey, a guy can only dream!
