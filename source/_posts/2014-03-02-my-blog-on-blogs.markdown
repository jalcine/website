I had this weird thought about web logs (or blogs); that they had to have these
long-winded and magical entries about whatever one might think them to be
about; be it on fashion, technology or what have you. I looked to older blogs
and noticed that they served more as a note keeper for one's thoughts and
helps the act of validation. So, I think I'd use this blog for more of that
than me attempting to increase my vanity quota.

I've been in a bit of a need to see my thoughts before actually attempting to
implement some ideas or just thoughts in general. There's the risk of having
this blog out in the open and since social media makes the discovery of
information a bit more possible that I would have to "mind my manners". I
might, but good chance I won't. I can't see a good reason to censor or dilute
my thoughts and opinions for the sake of vanity.

The biggest things on my mind right now are personal projects and finding
permanent employment and moving out of the gig lifestyle. I've fully resisted
the want to go to college mainly because right now, it doesn't have what I'd
be interested in; and there's so many more ways to learn things nowadays. The
telephone's been around for a century but we barely use it for its purpose (if
it were to be used in its classic sense); but that's my two cents on it.

Little side projects like plug-ins for Vim[^1] and C++ libraries[^2] are
geared to accelerate the development of a focused project I've come to grow
with, namely [Wintermute][1]. The original ideas for it were pure grandeur but
I have a more distilled, feasible and probably more entertaining idea of it
now (that to be in placed in a later post). If there's one thing that I've
been learning a lot that isn't really preached enough, it's that you learn
best when you break something of your own. You pay more attention to things
that matter to you due to the level of attachment to it you have. It's weird,
but it's been working for me.

So far, the work life has been so-so. I've been doing a few gigs for clients
that are typically internal (Intranet work and the sort) and it isn't very
front facing. The last thing that I did that's [viewable on the Web][3] is mainly
the [Leap Motion][2] integration to a little Sinatra app that uses the Tumblr
API to grab images relating to Martin Luther King Jr and the Civil Rights
Movement. It was part of a hackathon hosted by Tumblr and I loved it; thought
it was dope. I tend to choke a bit when presenting; but once I'm warmed up,
I'm another cat up there.

This ended up being a lot longer than I anticipated and I even let my computer
read it back to me. But the prose (right word?) feels right; it's
conversational and a bit archival, the real intent of this and others to come!
