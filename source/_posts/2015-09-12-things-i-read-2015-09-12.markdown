I track my reading habits using [Reading.am][] and occasionally, I work on
providing a week review of the things I've read here with a short blurb. This is
my way of writing a _really short_ book report but not for books and definitely
not a report.

## Digital Publications

### [Yak Shaving Defined - I'll get that done, as soon as I shave this yak.][link:1]

[Scott][] has a habit of cranking out some really useful posts and this, by far, is
one that I have bookmarked and revisit often. [Yak shaving][1] is amazingly well
depicted by that GIF he uses from Malcolm in the Middle:

![Hal, can you change the lightbulb?](http://i.minus.com/ibaDjk7AeIcvxv.gif)

### [Blavityâ€™s August Review: Curls, podcasts and #BlackGirlMagic][link:2]

If you haven't noticed already, I'm a *very big* fan of Blavity. The minute I
found out about it, I've taken extra time out of my day to read the published
content and mention it to friends. I have a hoodie _and_ a t-shirt. I'm
potentially obsessed, heh.

I'm also glad to see New York City at the top of the list of places that hits
Blavity the most[^1]. This and the geographic move to the East Coast are things
to keep an eye out for. The East Coast's the best coast, by the way. 

### [All Websites Look The Same][link:3]

**Where is the lie?** Hegemonic thoughts leads to hegemonic stuff :frog: :tea:.

### [Debugging Diversity][link:4]

{% quote author:"Anjuan Simmons" title:"Debugging Diversity" url:"https://abernathymagazine.com/debugging-diversity/" %}
Diversity in technology is often presented as a numbers game. Huge companies
such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Linkedin, and others jump-started the
conversation about diversity in tech a couple of years ago by publishing their
diversity numbers. While numbers are necessary, however, they are insufficient
to fully solve the diversity problem in tech. 
{% endquote %}

It's not something that can be readily solved with an off-the-shelve
algorithm[^2], or with empty quotes for close to 5 years stating "We're
working hard on fixing shit whilst not ever attempting to hire from places
that are predominately NOT like us". Anjuan hits home with this.

## Physical Publications

Because books with physical pages are still cool.

### [Slavery By Another Name][book:1]
Right now, I'm going over the chapter **Slavery is Not A Crime** in [Slavery By
Another Name][book:1]. This book, I have to say, is one that I've found so
interesting, I've legit re-read pages close to five times before advancing.
Blackmon condenses a lot on each page and still manages to make it paint a
picture of the events as they played out in the eras mentioned in the book. If
you don't have it, buy it.

### [The ThoughtWorks Anthology 2][book:2]

I've read this book before in 2013 and intentionally took time to crawl through
it over a period of six months. But reading it again now with more experience
gave me a more objective view to not only the kind of tools that were available
when the book was written _and_ the kind of ideologies that the authors held.
Things like TDD for JavaScript was portrayed as if it was frown upon[^3]. If
there's one thing this book constantly reminds me of, it's definitely the
importance of understanding the tools that you use to a point of near expert
levels. It makes it a lot easier to test.

Also, this book implicitly reinforced the idea of needing to not be afraid to
_look into the source code_. This, in itself, can be a whole blog post.

That's it for this week. I take suggestions for things to read very openly via
email or Twitter. Let's see if I can keep this up :running:!
