If there's one thing I've been lacking in, it's being a *social coder*.
I'm a social(-ish) person but I'm not that social when it comes to code.
I've noticed that the best code is written by people who are out
there communicating their thoughts, like the jQuery or Vim projects.
It makes sense since you're *using a language* to express an idea 
into a logical (or functional) flow. Communication of an idea is 
absolutely required then.

[Ben][1] wrote a [very light post][2] about getting a first job as a Rails
developer. Of course, the details of the post can be applied to most other
languages and practices, be it Android, iOS, web design or even C++, have you!
But it'd have to be proven for that to be fact. Nonetheless, it did get me
thinking; I have this blog and I occasionally post about little things that
don't really show my current situations with code. I've decided to write a
post at least twice a week about my current code projects and things I've
learned in code. It not only helps people who are just searching for stuff on
the Web, but it serves as a memory anchor for me so I don't have to remember
details.

As the Doctor would put it, **Hello**!
