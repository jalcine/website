It was a very interesting interviewing cycle for me. I went through three
other companies before this happened; but starting the 21st of April, I'll be
a software engineer at the ever-fabulous [Shutterstock][sstk]! It's a very big
change of scenery for me since I've been nose-deep in Ruby and C++ work. At
Shutterstock, I'd be using these languages and more to help build the best
technology there is when it comes to selling royalty-free images.

I'll probably document my time and what I learn there every two weeks or so,
you guys would be here all the way (just with no work, haha). One thing I had
to do was prep my shell environment for more agnostic work across different
languages. Things like Vim were starting after a minute on a cold boot and
bash took forever and a week to start. After a hour or so in `#vim` on
Freenode, I managed to get it up and running in a third of a second, with a
cold boot of 9 seconds. Magic! I didn't get to do that to my Bash setup yet;
but it's relatively quick; about two seconds cool boot and a third of a second
for a warm start.

Let the fun begin! Snap on (I guess, haha)!
