I'm working on a personal project that makes uses of [Hapi][] for its API layer.
I've managed to go about in a mostly test-driven fashion and worked from the
bottom up (from data modeling up to the route definition). Whilst working on
the ability to test the response states of routes, I noticed a few problems when
using the [Chai][] plugin for HTTP testing, [`chai-http`][chai-http]. For
completeness, here is what I'm working with[^1]:

{% highlight javascript %}
// @file app/routes/animal.js
const Hapi = require('hapi')
let myServer = new Hapi.Server()

myServer.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/magic',
  handler: (request, reply) => {
    reply('pokemon')
  }
})

module.exports = myServer
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
// @file test/routes/animal_test.js
const Server = require('../../app/routes/animal')
const Chai = require('chai')

Chai.use(require('chai-http'))

// TODO: HOW?
{% endhighlight %}

That `TODO` part tripped me up. Checking Hapi's documentation, I noticed that
Hapi exposed a HTTP server object via [server.listener][]. This gave me the
idea of doing this:

{% highlight javascript %}
// @file test/routes/animal_test.js
const Server = require('../../app/routes/animal')
const Chai = require('chai')
const assert = Chai.assert

Chai.use(require('chai-http'))

const mockServer = Chai.request(Server.listener)

mockServer.get('/magic').end(function(err, res) {
  assert.isNull(err)
  assert.statusCode(res, 200)
  assert.equal(res.result, 'pokemon')
})
{% endhighlight %}

This _should_ work. But it didn't :cry:[^2]

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

_Definitely_ not what I was looking for. And to be honest, I feel like this
requires me to get closer into how this works and I plan to make a follow-up
post to do this. In the interim, I've resorted to using [server.inject][] to
simulate requests:

{% highlight javascript %}
'use strict'

const Server = require('../../app/routes/animal')
const Chai = require('chai')
const assert = Chai.assert

const reqOpts = {
  method: 'GET',
  url: '/magic'
}

describe('Server', function () {
  it('gives me the work', function () {
    Server.inject(reqOpts, function (res) {
      assert.equal(res.statusCode, 200)
      assert.equal(res.result, 'pokemon')
    })
  })
})
{% endhighlight %}

Running this with [Mocha][] gave me this:

{% highlight bash %}
⌂ hapi-chai-testing  λ  mocha test/routes/animal_test.js


  Server
    ✓ gives me the work


  1 passing (33ms)
{% endhighlight %}

**Boom**. This kind of sucks. I really like the tools from Hapi and friends but
this little barrier of interoperability between libraries and larger projects
sucks. Again, since I found a _working_ solution, there's no heavy need for me
to get this working with `chai-http` at the moment. But if I or anyone else
figure this out, I'll be sure to provide a new blog post.

For compatibility information, this is me testing this on Hapi 9.3.0, but
this'll apply for older versions of Hapi (tested on 8.8.1, the version I'm using
in my project).
