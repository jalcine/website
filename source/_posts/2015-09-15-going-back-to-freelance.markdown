Two months ago, I've posted a tweet about me leaving freelance and openly
searching for full-time work:

{% twitter oembed https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/622631537322950656 %}

I posted that tweet with hopes of landing a position within _two months_. From the
second week of July to August 29th, I've interviewed at 13 different
companies from that date until 29 August. Some companies were large, some
small and some in between and have been turned down by _all but 2_[^1]. That's
like two rejections a week. After the first three, I switched up
my approach a bit but the one prevalent message that I've got from everyone
was that I didn't have enough experience. I don't advertise myself as a
senior developer[^2] and I bluntly admit if I don't know something.

Surprisingly enough, that 'lack of knowledge' of something conventionally
hyper-specific to a company is something I'm supposed to somehow know without
actually working in most of these places. Speaking with some of the hiring
managers about things that could have been improved, it's generally fallen in one
of the following statements.

> We need someone who thinks the same way our team does.

I can (barely) understand how one gets to the conclusion here. It's _generic_.
But from what I know, an environment like that could result in a lot of
'yes' with no real challenging of the ideas brought to the table. This is what
I think to be true from experience. All of the places I worked at before was
filled of people with different work backgrounds and levels of experience. That
led to very interesting discussions on well, _anything_. It also resulted in
learning experiences for those (like myself) who didn't understand larger
components and gave more experienced developers a chance to reinforce their
thought process and even see if it was worth implementing. There's a saying
that thinking out loud helps with the validation process of an idea.

> We're looking for someone who's more familiar with our practices and conventions.

This came from a company who didn't really have a public facing developer
environment for people to introspect. I was comparing it to something of the
nature of [Etsy][1], [AirBnB][2] or [Shutterstock][3]. It's pretty difficult to
see how your engineering team thinks without something of this nature. Pushing
that 'blame' to me is inconsiderate, in my opinion.

> Your background and experience doesn't seem mature enough for our team's needs.

This one is one I've gotten quite a bit and silently baffles me. I've expanded a
bit on [my resume][4] about my experience at companies and had people contact me
based on what _they've read there_. Now, when we get to the phone conversation,
I'm legitimately repeating what I've written there[^3]. So for one to tell me
that my experience isn't necessarily what they're looking for shows me that you
didn't bother to check out these pages _intended_ to give you a bit of
background about myself and instead wasted both of our time with this phone
call.

## Passively Looking for Full-time Work

Because of my shitty[^4] and exhausting experiences dealing with just the
interview cycle, I've decided to gradually move back into freelancing. This is
not going to heavily inhibit me from continuing to look for freelance work but I
feel that this'll give me more of a foundation for less questions regarding my
background to be asked. But this will make the bar personally higher for
companies that want to hire me and places that I'd consider working at. Working
as a freelance developer is not easy but waiting in constant disappointment
about job interviews really tears down one's psyche. For those wishing to refer
me to prospective clients, send them to <https://jacky.wtf/work/freelance>.

This post isn't a reflection of companies that I'm currently interviewing with
at the moment (some **amazing** ones), moreso with ones I've interviewed at in the
past (up to with confirmed 'no' on August 29th, 2015).

Again, my intent now is to build up a larger portfolio of work I've done just
for my personal background. There's definitely some agencies I'd consider
working with but for the few months, I need to do this on my own.

[^1]: Two of them have blockers that are outside of HR acceptance.
[^2]: To be honest, I see myself as an advanced junior developer. To be honest, we need to find a better naming and assertion tool to determine what good 'title' to give to developers.
[^3]: I find this mildly insulting, due to my efforts to expand then. I'm open to suggestions.
[^4]: For lack of a better term.
