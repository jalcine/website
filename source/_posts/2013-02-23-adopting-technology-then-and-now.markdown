This is 2013. We have some awesome technology out here in the wild, like
Google Glass, Vuzix and some other awesome guys working into the field. I'm a
very big fan of tech, being a developer and all. But it's not that welcoming
to people who don't understand it. But before I get all crazy about it, I have
to explain what I want to appreciate.

Technology is beginning to move faster than most people can adopt to. We're 
producing more phones, laptops, and other devices each quarter than even 
before. I currently own a [ASUS laptop](http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/K53e),
a [Google tablet](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb), and an
[LG Android phone](http://www.metropcs.com/metro/detail/LG+Motion%E2%84%A2+4G/LGMS770).
Realistically, this is enough for one person. But I also own a personal 
television rigged to switch to my PC input when used, a pair of Bluetooth 
headphones that I use when I'm using my tablet or laptop out of the house, 
a wireless mouse; [the list goes on](/).

## NFC: Near Field Awesomeness 
![From a poster in the street, you can download music, coupons, tickets...](images/posts/nfc_samsung_galaxy_s3.jpg)

[NFC](http://idea.imano.com/2011/05/nfc-for-dummies/) is the beginning of
awesome, contactless technology. Think of it of wireless data bursts flying
faster than we can see. The technology is something quite simple, it uses 
[magentic induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_induction) to 
implement a means of immediate data transfers. Think of it as plugging your 
phone to your computer with no cables but only transferring a small document 
(kilobytes) as opposed to a audio file (megabytes).

> But this is stupid. A little charge between my phone? How is this any better

![QR Code](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Wikipedia_mobile_en.svg/220px-Wikipedia_mobile_en.svg.png)

Using QR (Quick Response) codes is tersely similar to this process. With 
a higher density of squares, you could, of course, store a lot of data. But 
QR codes have proven to be very intrustive when it comes to decor. The 
practice would require adopting the image into design, a burden not needed. 
NFC tags remove this burden by having wires instead being placed under or 
within materials and design so patrons of it can interact with head-on. So 
from a design aspect, it's quite useful.

For hardware manufactors, no effort is required. If anything, it's up to the 
manufactors to provide cameras with no delay in capture. Since QR codes are purely 
a software implementation and depiction of data, it's merely up to having 
a standard means of interpreting said data and building a quick and easy 
library for developers to tie in such a function into the application. There's 
programs out there like [Phewtick](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phewtick),
[EventBrite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eventbrite.attendee),
and [Fandango](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fandango)
that make heavy use of QR codes in current use but could be greatly improved
in its effectiveness if NFC technology were used in place of it.

## Augumented Reality

This concept of merging computer graphics and reality is something done a LOT,
and we take it for granted. Most films created make heavy use of
[CGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery) to add some of
those amazing fangs, wings and flight scenes we adore in film. Well, a lot of
techies out there figured it to be an awesome idea. 

## Visually
{% youtube v1uyQZNg2vE %}

That video wasn't edited to include those graphics to the upper left, this is
[*Google Glass*](http://www.google.com/glass). It's here and it's getting
better each and every day. Personally, I'd love to have it, but it'd be more
of a toy then anything else. Unless you're a constant hitchhiker, travelling
the world and what not, it'd be perfect for you. Translate would be your best
friend. It also has the best implications for news journalists who happen to
be on site and wish to collect data as they go. Self-documentation became a
LOT easier.

The use case of this is quite limited but it can expand as the world itself
grows to more of a technologically-connected planet. For example, shopping for
clothes, food, or anything in general would become a lot simpler. Picking up
an item and scanning the barcode with glass would allow you to potentially
purchase it then and there. You could skip the entire line by just producing a
digital certificate representing your purchase; it could potentially re-invent
shopping.

### Physically

{% youtube 3b4w749Tud8 %}

[LeapMotion](http://leapmotion.com) is, hands on, the craziest cool piece of
technology I've personally seen. It brings hand gestures and control to any
device that can connect to it. You can potentially learn how to mold clay pots
without getting ready or emulate the act of driving a car without having to
leave the comfort of home. This allows for a whole new level of interaction
for the desktop (and larger!) systems, but it's very young.

This is something that could be extremely useful in medical places, if a
doctor had a full-body scan of a human being, they could easily spin, zoom and
manipulate the body without having to do it on the actual person for
simulation purposes. This could also lead to better video games that promote
one's wellness and stability. In short, the Leap Motion is the ticket to
mobility in a place where only fingers were needed.

## Intelligent Assistants

Some of these guys need no introduction. But I will anyways. Introducing **Google Now** and **Siri**.

### Google Now
Below is [Google Mobile](http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleMobile?feature=watch)'s video about [Google Now](http://www.google.com/now).

{% youtube pPqliPzHYyc %}

[Google Now](http://www.google.com/now) is fucking awesome, but only if you're
a Googler. If you store your contacts, e-mails, calendar, news (via Reader and
searches in the Knowledge Graph), then Google Now becomes your very best
friend. I've actually gotten so attached, I check it in the morning, lunch,
dinner and before I knock out for sleep. It tells me what I'd like to know at
a very balanced level. It's Google's way to understanding what you'd like to
know before you know, thus curating to your pre-born needs. [Inception,
much?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3-a58Wt2tk).

### Siri
{% youtube rNsrl86inpo %}

Siri, from my research and tinkering, attempts to be your pocket assistant. It
doesn't do any heavy lifting compared to Google Now. It waits for you to ask a
question in order. It doesn't seem to "pry into" your information like Google
Now, but it does leverage a lot of its work on Wolfram Alpha and Nuance's
speech technology.
