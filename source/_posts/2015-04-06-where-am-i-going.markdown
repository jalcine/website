Someone asked me a really good question a month ago; one that I thought I had
the answer to. Plainly put, it was just this:

> **Where do you see yourself in the future professionally?**

It's not that simple of a question but it's something you think your average
young adult might have some idea of what the answer would be. I couldn't think
of an answer off the top of my head. I quickly thought of what I've spent my time
currently doing, what I like doing and what I can see myself doing for a longer
period of time (but not for the rest of my life). I'm quite the enthusiast for
all things [artificial intelligence][1] related, but it's more so on the side of
improving human-computer interactions. Despite my lack of a collegiate education, I
have a working knowledge of computer theory and picked up calculus thanks to
[MIT OCW][2]. Of course, there's a ceiling that I'm starting to see and it's (and
the ever-endearing encouragement of family and friends) leading me to go towards
the academic route for more training into the fields of study that I think I'll
need to continue my endeavors. It's going to be heavily math-based and I don't
know if I'm ready for it just yet so venturing into it will be fun. When I say
academia, I don't necessarily mean higher education. I might take up private
tutoring and have concepts taught that way. I'm not too big of a fan of taking
up debt from institutions that can only ensure you get a really expensive
receipt.

I don't know how to have this chat with myself so I've (quasi) documented it.
I've already written a bit about how and kind of [why I began programming][3]
but it doesn't really explain why I should continue. I've also had moments
where I felt like I should stop programming altogether and consider a different
career path [^1] and in some cases where [the industry did shun me][1]. I had
[doubts about continuing][2] as a programmer. But I still spend at least three
hours of every waking day working on some particular project. Why?
Because I **like** doing it.

I like having the ability to make something out of nothing. I'm an enthusiast
for art and in its own regard, programming is a form of art; the molding and
crafting of idealistic models into something digitally tangible[^2], something
that other people can use, enjoy and extend[^3].
