Resumes are people's way of saying that they've said they've done _X, Y or Z_.
Most people take it at face value and go with it. I'm more interested now in
making something that's a bit more informational. Having a resume as a PDF is
completely useless as a medium and seems to be enforced by hiring teams. The
work I produce isn't usually static, so I don't see why this should be. If you
want to see the latest incarnation of it, check it out under [my work page][1].
Right now, everything about it is meant to useful for those curious about
specific tasks taken at a particular job and what I did there. That's all that
I'm going to say on that.
