> Hackathons don't create new hackers.

This is not _completely_ true. Hackathons have definitely proven to me that people can
build some really silly shit over night; some of which who doubted their skill
and cursed all throughout the night. This would have been more accurate if
phrased "Hackathons aren't a place to do a startup pitch. It's a hackathon
not a pitchathon"; that's something hackathons have definitely run amok with.

This, I feel, comes from a mismanagement of the team. The first thing I tend to
do whenever I'm a hackathon with a new team is take 10 to 15 minutes to
determine the following about the team:

  * Who's *really good* at X?
  * Who's *really bad* at X?
  * Who are the blacksmiths?
  * Who are the minutemen?

Blacksmiths are people who can take a set of steps and hammer them out without
too much questioning. Minutemen are people who can relay a message from one
person to another without too much latency _and_ who can translate it if
necessary. It's similar to having product owners and engineers on an
agile(-ish) team.

Also when you're able to determine who can do what, it becomes a _lot_ easier
to see who should handle what parts of the app (or apps) over a mini roadmap
of sorts. Some people don't agree with this "over-planning" and think it takes
away from the moment. I'm one to plan as often as I can so this seems like
second nature.

**Welp**.

This is easy to do if you have a bunch of friends who code and tend to frequent
to hackathons on nearly-bi-monthly basis. Living in New York, hackathons (read:
not pitch-a-thons) are a dime a dozen and not too many people I know tend to be
engineers (that I speak to on a regular basis as well as share a cup of tea
with).

The resonating point of Ian's post lies here:

Couldn't agree more.
