Earlier today, I patched up the code-base for [`cmake.vim`][cmake.vim] and
pushed out [version 0.1.9][stable] to the world and on [Vim.org][vimscripts].
This plug-in hits home since I use CMake a *lot* for Wintermute and KDE
project building.

## What Can It Do?

Right now, function is quite minimal. [The documentation][docs] goes over to
its minimal detail as to what it can do. For one, this helps when just trying
to get things up and running with CMake projects.

## What's Planned?

Well, next steps for this is to move the raw system call to make and call
`:make` instead so that we can get the functionality of `:cwindow` into the
mix. Also, I'm still hacking at it to pull information about flags and what
not to expose to other plug-ins like Syntastic and YouCompleteMe.

Another is to expand its form and allow it to build specific targets though
this can be easily done once `makeprg` is set to the correct paths, also
providing automatic command-line completion. **Wham!**

Snippets are something we could all use for CMake but I won't be adding them
to this project. Instead, I strongly recommend adding [vim-snippets][snippets]
to your plug-ins and using what they provide.

That said, please enjoy said plug-in and feel free to fork, rant, and patch to
your heart's content!
