Scott's a frequent blogger and had an entry recently about [blogs as
the cog of an online community][1]; I pulled this quote from the
post and posted it on Twitter:

{% twitter oembed https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/633130781464989696 %}

It's a simple statement but it made me really think. As opposed to just shooting
off random thoughts on a platform you don't necessarily own; there's the option
of expressing your thoughts in a more concise and controlled manner. If you
follow me on Twitter, you know that I have a habit of tweeting frequently[^1]
but recently I feel like anything that I'd want to save that's either meaningful
or worthwhile is lost in the super-fast current that is Twitter. This post isn't
really a mantra of mine to "keep on blogging" but more so for the reason. It
absolutely does not matter what you're interested in; as long as you continue
providing content that you find as meaningful, I think you should write on it.

[Anil Dash][] wrote a post about [things he's learned while blogging][2] and
it's filled with very useful points[^2]. Here's one that stuck out to me:

**There is absolutely no pattern to which blog posts people will like.** I've
had pieces that I worked on for years that landed with a thud, ignored by
even my close friends, and I've had dashed-off rants explode into huge
conversations on the web. I've had short pieces or silly lists that people
found meaningful, and lengthy, researched work that mostly earned a shrug.
And of course, I've had pieces that I put my heart and soul into that did
connect with people. If there's a way to predict what response will be
online, I sure don't know it.

As far as we know, there isn't a real "Midas touch" to blog posts. Which is
good!

This is one of those "just do it!" kind statements you'd want on those
pseudo-motivational entries to help you continue writing more often. But this
(should) be more than that. Outside of social networks, our personal blogs
provide a very dense versions of our thoughts over time[^3]. I've noticed that
most of the answers for problems I've run into have either been answered on
a blog, re-examining source code or StackOverflow, in a order of descending
probability. As a developer, I sometimes think that having a blog and pushing
out problems you've had and approaches to solving it is one fantastic way to
contribute to the communities you're interested in if sending a patch or
updating documentation isn't something you think that you can do. Over time,
your blog posts could be a form of undocumented behavior that people run into
often; thus potentially being promoted to legit documentation.

What I'm saying, If I'm saying anything at all[^4], is that blogging is a
low-barrier, time-semi-consummative process that can help you become move
visible in development communities and also round out your digital profile.

**Update** 2015-09-14 12:32:41 EDT: Heh, I did _not_ see that timestamp on
Scott's post. It's close to four years old! Curious now as to how it surfaced up
on my radar!

[^1]: It's nearly uncontrollable now! Seriously, follow me for a week and I might end taking over your timeline, heh. But it'll give you a perspective in Black cutlure, with a mix of nerdiness, development, and food.
