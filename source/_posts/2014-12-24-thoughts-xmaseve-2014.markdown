It's been a very rough three months for me. Three months of hair pulling and
anguish. And then it happens with *irrefutable evidence* here in New York City,
where I *knew* it would, but I didn't think it'd happen so soon[^1]. **You never
think it'll happen so soon**. Then I left everything and held it down for my
city. Well, not the city, but the people living in the city because it
doesn't seem like the City care for its "disadvantaged" residents anymore.

I'm obviously speaking on police brutality that's been used as a medium to
express extreme forms of racism and sexism. Don't even get me started on how
disgusting the media (and our _own_ brothers) when it comes to the erasure of
women (actually, everyone but men) when it comes to this form of abuse,
[Jamilah Lemieux][femyt] of [Ebony][eb] has a 
[whole video dedicated to this][femtw]. This isn't so much about that, 
for me at least. This is about how I've noticed my personal disconnect from 
things I love doing and my slow distancing from people I care about.
It's Christmas Eve and my family doesn't really Christmas like that, despite
some unspoken mantra that we should be more giggly this time of
year. I wake up, wrestle, eat with and sleep on top of these people for the
last twenty years of my life. Any closer and all of the Alcin√©s would become a
hivemind! It's not good, even my brother's mentioned he doesn't see me anymore.
I'm going to fix this by doing what I've done before, when I was a bit more
ignorant in 2011. I'm going to spend large portions of time with my family
these few days. As we all should; God forbid this crooked system deem our
families next in their hit list.

I've spoken to a few people that I've considered affluent on this and I'm
getting the vibe that I might need to shift gears. Being a foot solider is
definitely necessary, if not required as being a Black individual, but it's not
the best use of the skills I have at my disposal. Things like making sniffers
for [stringray devices][sd] more portable or helping educate people to use
encrypted means of communications to make core leadership more evasive from law
enforcement interception (because this is all about civil disobedience) and the
such are things I can help with.

## **And I Will.**

[^1]: I was stupid for thinking that, thinking that we were safe. No one is safe; nothing makes me or them special from their prowl.
