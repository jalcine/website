If you do a quick search on some public keyservers like `pgp.mit.edu` and the
likes under the user ID `jackyalcine@gmail.com` or maybe `me@jalcine.me`;
you'll find too many keys that are attached to my name. And the sad thing is
all of them are keys I did create and upload in hopes that it'd be the last
time I'd have to do so.

I have a habit of messing up my disk drive about every three months or so and
thus, it's shown to leave its mark on the Interwebs. I've *finally* worked out
a solution to this and you can rest assured that one key will be the *one key*
I'll use for the rest of time (all things willing). That key is `6E767393`.
It'll be available for downloading (the public key) at [a short link][gpg] and
I'll upload it to places.

I know, I've polluted keyservers. But if I could work on getting them deleted
from the public ones, I'd do it now. The fingerprint for my key is `A1A5 A0EB
B69F 23AE 67B6  F914 2A23 4ABC 6E76 7393`. I learned my lesson. I also learned
a lot more [about GPG from Alan Eliasen][gpgblogpost]; definitely recommend
reading into that.
