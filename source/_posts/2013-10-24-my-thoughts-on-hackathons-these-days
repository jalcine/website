In my years of being a programmer, I've attended five hackathons to
date. Or that's at many as I can recollect. I plan to attend more in the name
of hackathons, but that begets the question: **what exactly is a hackathon?**
I don't think I'd have the authoritative word on this mainly because of years of
experience with hackathons but from what I gather, I thought that the whole
goal of the event was to really just build *something*; not an SaaS, not a
startup, just something that bordered on the line of "working". The thing that
kills me is that most of these events usually come with some kind of incentive
to lull developers in. It takes a bit more keen in a person to realize that
modern-day hackathons are nothing more than a over-hyped incubator for apps
that just might make it in the (young) mobile application landscape.

## Not Like What It Used to Be

Speaking from personal interest, I attended my first AngelHack hackathon in
the fall of 2012 at Alley NYC (w00t!) out of the amazing[^1] suggestion of
good friends of mine[^2]. Needlessly to say, I didn't regret going. I watched
as some people ruthlessly opened and demolished IDEs and console text editors
building and crafting God knows what at insane hours in the morning. It'd get
closer and closer to dawn and still you have people just cracking away as if
it was 2PM in the afternoon. It's amazing what soda, beer and Red Bull can do.
I was interested to see what people managed to throw together (since at the
time, I barely was able to contribute to my team at such weird constraints).
It kind of rubbed me weird when I saw that more of the "winning" and
contesting hacks that were presented were either presentations thrown together
by a design team **weeks ago**, full-blown applications with *an existing user
base* here looking for a way to raise seed capital or just vaporware
altogether[^3].

I remember watching The Social Network, the story of Mark Zuckerburg and gang
making the initial days of Facebook from a bedroom hack to a whole business
shebang. And what I saw there was *nothing* like what I've experienced at the
last few hacks. Maybe I'm going to the wrong ones but it seems like we have to
go into these things with a product manager, a UI/UX designer, a ninja devops
guy and two other back-end developers to even be a (worthy of) competing team.
And the whole idea of these hackathons are to be judged by sometimes people
who aren't developers themselves but people who critique things. So now, we
have this influx of apps that are born out of the influx of fighting to be
relevant over-night to attempting to be the very next best thing and to be
honest, it's shameful. It's totally not what I expected and until hackathons
are a bit more ethical, I don't think I'd recommend going to one.

## Change's Near

I did have a chat about this with one of the pals and we came to a consensus
that hackathons aren't hackathons; but rather "build-a-startup-MVP-over-night"-athon.
Realistically, that's what these things are. Five out of seven people who
attend are coming for some kind of "cash" prize. I can't lie, I came to my
latest hackathon, the Tizen App Challenge one, only so I could get the RD-PQ
developer device. And now, I kind of hate it[^4]. But it was holding that
device did I really let all of this sink in. The developers, hackers, coders
and designers out there can fix this problem, though.

[^1]: More like peer-pressure, lol.
[^2]: My two awesome developer friends, [Ashwin][] and [Arunram][]! Seriously, if not for these guys, I don't think I would be where I am today.
[^3]: Confession: I did work on a hack that was based from a Flinto demo; but
the final result didn't even use those mockups for the app; the demo was
presented before we went into the app.
[^4]: That's a whole another entry.
