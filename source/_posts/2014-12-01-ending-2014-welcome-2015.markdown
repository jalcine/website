It's about that time again here in New York. No snow touched the ground yet but
commercials and adverts here make you feel as if a blizzard's pending and the
_only_ good idea is to buy everything before you can't anymore. Instead, I've
taken time this month to reflect on the places I've been this year and see how
I can get even more done in the upcoming year.

## Personal Projects
![Damn it, forgot to use my Yubikey][imhud]
If you haven't known by yet, I'm quite obsessed with the concept of home
automation, artificial intelligence and very specifically, the replication and
building of an architecture similar to that of [J.A.R.V.I.S][jarvis], the
personal AI that Tony Stark has with him. I have a project, dubbed
[Wintermute][] that's meant to be the heart of the sub-system my version of
said project would work on. Written largely in C++, it's meant to be a
relatively portable library that would be extended upon for a common
sub-language between entities, be it a embedded computer or an application on a
Chromecast. It's overly ambitious, a perfect excuse to use whatever new
technologies are out there and perhaps can touch a lot of aspects of programming.
It's my means of permanently increasing my breadth of knowledge, if
you may.

## Traveling
![Palm trees in Silver Lake, Los Angeles][flickr-travel]
I've been always one to take photos of places I've gone and attempt to capture
my environment. Although (I think) Flickr didn't announce it in 2014, their
encouraging (and quite generous) one TB of image space lit a micro fire under
my ass to take up photography yet again. Thus, on my last weekend trip to Los
Angeles[^1], I took my handy [Nikon L830][cam_nikon_l830] and whenever time
permitted, snapped pictures of said environment. I even took home a souvenir!
Traveling has been something my mom and dad always convinced me to do but
I've been really bad about actually _doing_ it.


## Reading
I've managed to step up my literature game _a lot_ this year. Especially
with services like [Goodreads][] and [Oyster][] to make recording your reading
progress as well as reading on mobile and laptop a bit more pleasurable. I've
been in constant debate of rolling something similar to Goodreads but
magnitudes lighter in design. It'd be something of a list keeping application;
allowing one to just record books in multiple lists. Some of the titles I've
read over and over this year include [The New Jim Crow][tnjc], [an Iron Man
comic][imc] and [The Pragmatic Programmer][tpp]. Diverse enough of a topic set,
but all relating to things I value and enjoy.

# Into 2015
![Squad.][dis]
It's probably not a good idea for me to plan too sternly into 2015, since even
I'm not too sure on what it might happen, but there's a few things I'd like to
get done. 2014 was my first year as a legal adult[^2], so having a full year
to rampage across the world should be enlightening. Apologies for rampaging in
your part of the world in advance[^3].

## First Minor Release of Wintermute
![Image of Wintermute's "old-master" branch, for history's sake.][wntrimg1]
Wintermute's a pretty old project for me. It's about four years old with no
release binaries at all. A few reasons for this include school, work and the
unpredictable nature of life. I have to admit though, a *lot* has changed with
the project so the [first minor release's change log][fmrc-wntr] is going to be
exciting to see. Realistically, it should be almost seamless then to get it
working within virtualization containers like Vagrant or Docker for full-stack
testing.

## Dive Deeper into Hardware
It seemed a bit inevitable since Wintermute's going to require a shit ton of
information for it to be a irreplaceable aspect of life, but I've decided to
formally take on hardware engineering as a complete n00b in February 2015. I've
been pointed to things like the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and the Hummingboard
collection. I'm fairly confident that my landlord does **not** approve of one
building a DIY lock, so things like that are off the list for home automation.
It's definitely a bit of a tossup in this category, so there's time to pick
something.

## Compile A Picture-A-Day Album
This is probably going to be the toughest thing for me to do. But I want to
capture not only a picture of myself for every day in 2015, but also of the
places that I've traveled to that particular day. I'm debating on making either
of them publicly facing, might do a compilation shot of sorts. The underlying
purpose of the face capturing is actually part of a larger project (that
has ties to Wintermute).

# Ad Contraho
2014 is _done_ in my book, to be honest. This month is going to be spent cleaning
up things I should have whilst doing other things (like living). Getting my
cameras tided up as well prepping hardware for the next year is largely the
goal for this month. Until next year! &#x1f44b;

[^1]: This trip to Los Angeles was my first one to Southern California! Boy, was it great!
[^2]: That should _mean_ something here, but (from what I hear) Europeans get it good.
[^3]: Not sorry. At all. w00t!
