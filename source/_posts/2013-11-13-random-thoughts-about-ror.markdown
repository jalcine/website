This is a hammering of a few thoughts. I've been working with Ruby for about
three years now and the Rails framework for about a full one now. I have to
admit, the speed at which web applications can be built is really intriguing
compared to statically typed languages like C++ but that's probably a unfair
comparsion. Outside of Ruby, I've worked on hobby Web applications using 
[Zend][] and [Mojolicious][] with no real interest of taking it to market as a
skill. Rails was the turning point.

# Why Rails?
First and foremost, if you *really* did a bit of backend Web development, the
one thing that was always a concern was handling database migrations whenever
entity relationship diagrams changed (though I feel they shouldn't have).
Defining a SQL schema by hand and having PHP execute it before it was ran in
production (yes, bad practice, smell it) was less than routine but often
enough to be a problem.

One day, while I was in California for an event at Stanford, another engineer
suggested that we re-write the entire platform using Rails (3.2.6, if that
matters). I was really against initially out of a lack of knowledge of using
the framework but I caved in. After a bit of shoddy pair programming, my whole
opinion about the damned thing changed.

# Today?
After using and working with a few Rails applications, I'm not so sure I'd
want to *continue* using it. For starters, I'm a bit of a fan of being able to
tweak and hammer things to a particular setup (take my laptop, for example).
Rails is configurable, but in a very weird way. Again, good software has
'sane defaults', but I wouldn't consider most of the defaults for Rails to
be[^1].

People are looking to the whole "let's make an API!" stage with event-based
web stacks[^2] powered by Node/JavaScript and decoupling the .... hogwash. For
now, any serious disconnection from the current trends of application would
only occur when HTML5 is 100% out the door. And we know when that's happening.

[^1]: My options are slightly changing with these RCs of Rails 4. The fact
that more functionality is refactored out into separate gems make me a bit
more comfortable (i.e: protected_attributes, turbolinks). But they're RCs.
[^2]: Fun fact! Nearly every web application that exists is event-driven!
