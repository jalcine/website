I have been working to improve my habits this week and so far, this has been 
proven productive. I've managed to get a bit of an early morning workout 
including a full-body stretch so I'm feeling good. After I [check off some 
tasks](http://any.do) and get some music going, I can begin working on some 
personal projects and open-source work. Happy Monday!

The new habit I'm working towards is focused heavily on productivity. Using 
Any.Do and with heavy calendar use, I should be able to accomplish all of the 
work I have set out for myself. At the end of the week, I'll also try to 
provide a recap and determine what I'm lacking in. What's your weekly mission statement?
