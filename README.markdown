# jacky.wtf

This repository holds the sources to the statically generated website belonging
to Jacky Alcin√©. With input from a few friends, reading up on modern Web
performance and learning about my anonymous users' reading flows; I've decided
to rebuild the site in a new light.

## Mission
The goal of this new redesign of the repository is to provide me with a site
that makes it _easy_ to add new blog posts. This means how deployment and
configuration of the local development flow will change as well. [See the
documentation around deployment about that][1].
