# Jacky Alcin√©'s Website

This repository holds the source code for website, currently accessible at
https://jacky.wtf/. It's statically generated.

  * Built using Jekyll.

## Home Page

The landing page is meant to be a status rendering of what I'm currently working
on and/or doing. It incorporates information from services I use _a_ lot like:

  * Github
  * last.fm
  * Twitter
  * Last.fm
  * Foursquare + Swarm

It sounds data-heavy and that's because it is! Each load will be a blank slate
and just poll against a remote service that I'll host on Heroku to handle the
act of fetching new information to y'all.

## About

This page should be direct. It'll follow the idea of this page
https://archive.is/xGkgx but more typographically cleaner and what not.

## Work

This page needs to have information about my current employment and information
about potential consulting for light work (but that I'm not open to said
opporunities - that I can refer to high quality people).

## Projects

This should be a very dynamic page. It'll be done in a slideshow-esque fashion;
with each project providing its own 'well'. The landing page would be a bunch of
slits - each about 15% of the page with a title, imaage to the far right, and an
excerpt that expands to about 45% when someone hovers over it. The ability to
build this should be fully dynamic - pulling in information about these projects
on the fly.
